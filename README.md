# Eye_disease_detection_using_machinelearning
The purpose of this project is to design a machine learning-based system for the detection and diagnosis of eye diseases using medical images, such as retinal scans, fundus images, and OCT scans.This system will utilize ML techniques for getting an accurate and fast analysis that will lead to better patient outcomes by early diagnosis.
